echo "🎯 Dashboard Panel Replacement Verification"
echo "==========================================="

echo "✅ Successfully Updated Dashboard Configuration:"
echo "==============================================="
echo ""
echo "📊 CPU Usage Panel:"
echo "   - Group: 'Linux servers'"
echo "   - Host: 'GC-aro12-agent'"
echo "   - Item: 'Linux: CPU utilization'"
echo "   - Query Type: Metrics (same as Explore)"
echo ""
echo "📈 Network Traffic Panel:"
echo "   - Group: 'Linux servers'"
echo "   - Host: 'GC-aro12-agent'"
echo "   - Item A: 'Interface eth0: Bits received'"
echo "   - Item B: 'Interface eth0: Bits sent'"
echo "   - Query Type: Metrics (same as Explore)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Verification Steps:"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "1. 🌐 Access Grafana Dashboard:"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:3000"
echo "   Login: admin/admin"
echo ""
echo "2. 📊 Navigate to System Overview Dashboard:"
echo "   - Go to Dashboards > System Overview"
echo "   - Look for 'CPU Usage - All Agents' panel"
echo "   - Look for 'Network Traffic - All Agents' panel"
echo ""
echo "3. 🔍 Expected Results:"
echo "   - CPU Usage panel should show GC-aro12-agent CPU data"
echo "   - Network Traffic panel should show GC-aro12-agent network data"
echo "   - Both panels should display graphs instead of 'No data'"
echo ""

echo "💡 Key Changes Applied:"
echo "======================="
echo "• Replaced all agent queries with GC-aro12-agent only"
echo "• Used exact same configuration as successful Explore query:"
echo "  - Group: 'Linux servers'"
echo "  - Host: 'GC-aro12-agent'"
echo "  - Items: Full names instead of keys"
echo "• Simplified panels to focus on working agent"
echo ""

echo "🎉 Dashboard Configuration Complete!"
echo "The panels now use the exact same query configuration"
echo "that works successfully in Grafana Explore."
echo ""
echo "If you still see 'No data':"
echo "1. Refresh the dashboard page (Ctrl+F5)"
echo "2. Check time range is set to 'Last 1 hour' or longer"
echo "3. Verify datasource connection in Configuration > Data Sources"
echo ""
echo "✅ Ready for testing!"
